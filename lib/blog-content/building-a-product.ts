          <p class="mb-3 md:mb-4">Building a product is not mainly about writing code. I’ve said this multiple times.</p>

          <p class="mb-3 md:mb-4">I’ve been writing exams recently, while also trying to make deployment and infrastructure decisions for FUSELearn. And that contrast has forced a shift in how I think.</p>

          <p class="mb-3 md:mb-4">At some point, speed stops being about how fast you can write features, and starts being about how well your decisions age.</p>

          <p class="mb-3 md:mb-4 font-bold">Standard code matters. Architecture matters.</p>

          <p class="mb-3 md:mb-4">Knowing when to ship <em>now</em> and when to deliberately carry technical debt, then schedule time to clean it <em>yourself</em>, and not with AI.</p>

          <p class="mb-3 md:mb-4">A lot of the real problems don’t even come from the code. They come from infrastructure, configs, data flow, security, or decisions made too early or too late. I once chased a “bug” that turned out to be Cloudflare.</p>

          <p class="mb-3 md:mb-4">I’m also learning that products people love don’t <em>feel</em> engineered, even though they absolutely are underneath.</p>

          <p class="mb-3 md:mb-4">That balance… between correctness, scalability, UX, and timing is something I’m actively learning from strong product leadership.</p>

          <p class="mb-3 md:mb-4">Still building.</p>

          <p class="mb-3 md:mb-4">Grateful to God and for the product and leadership lessons around me, especially from the team guiding FUSELearn, <a href="https://fusevarsity.com" target="_blank" class="underline text-blue-600">fusevarsity.com</a></p>
