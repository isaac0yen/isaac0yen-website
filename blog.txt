"Heyyy, Please do you have [COURSE_CODE] PDF?"
This is the reality of University students on or shortly before examination period...
Not like I'm particularly a serious student(lauching emoji) but then, it's crucial that we have a unified platform for these things.
And it's quite funny that in the past 10 years no one has decided to take out time to solve this minor issue people have...
Eitherway, that's what Birthed StudyHub.

Fun Fact, this was supposed to be a political stunt for a friend, hence it's first version was rushed.

Node.js Backend, but PHP front end, and it's funny because I make fun of people who use a serverside language, particularly Next.js and then build a separate backend, but here we have it... I DID IT.

Moving on, I build and launched... had a couple of downloads and then just pushed aside.
But then EXAM CAMEEEEE!
And aside from the fact that I have the desease of wanting to build things during exams, this I even managed to supress it because it's me that knows what I'm fighting for bayi.(Laughing emoji)

Similar story to My Genius(By the way I'd be making a post about it soon...) we had exams and people needed NOTESSS.
Another thing that Helps me is NotebookLM audio summary so I just packed it there as part of the resources there and rebranded the entire software, optimized the code a bit and pushed out to UNILORIN students... As usualll...*shouts great nigerian students!!! the software got massive interactions, over 1000+ in downloaded resources with the audio summary being the top downloaded...(Learnt a thing or 2 about marketing from Gabriel[https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-ojumah-b03116299/])

After I saw the massive portntial, I added ads to display after a download(I need MONEYYYYYY!(CRYING EMOJI)) and I'm working on adding capabilities for other schools... still has minot bugs but on it.
