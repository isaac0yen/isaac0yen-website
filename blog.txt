What do we define as problems and are they really a bad thing?



Case study 1: We have a young adult who is looking for a skill to learn and get a source of income.



Case study 2: We have a young adult who just finished learning a skill or just graduated looking for ways to get a job.



Case study 3: We have a company founder who's looking for investment.



Case study 4: We have a billionaire who's trying to create a brand new industrial sector.



And the funny thing is, everyone who's at a particular point doesn't think of the fact that even after passing this phase, we have... probably a significantly more life choking category of problems ahead. 😂️



Is there any motivation here? NO! 😂️



The message here is to embrace what you call "problems" to be "challenges" and move on to the next category so you can solve bigger issues!



Finish school...

Learn that skill...

Find that job...

Start that company...

Find a way to scale...

And cause an impact however you want to.



Or just give up! 😂️
